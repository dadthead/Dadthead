    "On-Page SEO is the process of optimizing the content and HTML source code of a web page to make it more search engine-friendly and relevant to specific keywords. Unlike off-page SEO, which deals with backlinks and external signals, on-page SEO is completely within your control.\n\n" +
    "Key elements of on-page SEO include optimizing title tags, meta descriptions, header tags, URL structures, internal linking, and most importantly, high-quality content that matches user intent. Additionally, factors like page speed, mobile-friendliness, image optimization, and proper use of schema markup play crucial roles.\n\n" +
    "Strong on-page SEO not only helps improve your website’s visibility in search engine results but also enhances usability, engagement, and conversions. It ensures that both search engines and visitors understand the purpose and value of each page.\n\n" +
